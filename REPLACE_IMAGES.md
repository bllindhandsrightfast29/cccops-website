# Replace These Images

Drop your actual images into the `images/capabilities/` folder:

## 1. TAK Logo - `images/capabilities/tak-logo.jpg`
**Use the TAK badge image you showed me** (the one with the eagle/bird shield)
- Save as: `tak-logo.jpg`
- Size: 1200x800px recommended

## 2. VISUS Screenshot - `images/solutions/visus-dashboard.jpg` (coming next)
**Use your VISUS Enterprise screenshot** (green terminal interface)
- Save as: `visus-dashboard.jpg`
- Size: 1200x800px recommended
